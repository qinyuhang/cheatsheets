    end

    entry do
      name '204 No content'
      notes 'The server accepted the request but is not returning any content. This is often used as a response to a `DELETE` request.'
    end

      name '205 Reset content'
      notes 'Similar to a `204 No Content` response but this response requires the requester to reset the document view.'

    end

    entry do
      name '302 Found'

    end

    entry do
      name '303 See other'
      notes 'The resource can be retrieved by following other URI using the `GET` method. When received in response to a `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE`, it can usually be assumed that the server processed the request successfully and is sending the client to an informational endpoint.'
    end

    entry do
      name '304 Not modified'
      notes 'The resource has not been modified since the version specified in `If-Modified-Since` or `If-Match` headers. The resource will not be returned in response body.'

    entry do
      name '308 Permanent redirect'
      notes 'Experimental. The request and all future requests should be repeated with the URI provided in the response. The HTTP method is not allowed to be changed in the subsequent request.'

    end

    entry do
      name '401 Unauthorized'

      notes 'Reserved for future use. Some web services use this as an indication that the client has sent an excessive number of requests.'
    end

    entry do
      name '403 Forbidden'
      notes "The request was formatted correctly but the server is refusing to supply the requested resource. Unlike `401`, authenticating will not make a difference in the server's response."
    end

    entry do
      name '404 Not found'
      notes "The resource could not be found. This is often used as a catch-all for all invalid URIs requested of the server."
    end

    entry do
      name '405 Method not allowed'
      notes "The resource was requested using a method that is not allowed. For example, requesting a resource via a `POST` method when the resource only supports the `GET` method."
    end

    entry do
      name '406 Not acceptable'
      notes "The resource is valid, but cannot be provided in a format specified in the `Accept` headers in the request."
    end

    entry do
      name '407 Proxy authentication required'

      notes "The request is larger than what the server is able to process."
    end

    entry do
      name '414 Request-URI too long'
      notes "The URI provided in the request is too long for the server to process. This is often used when too much data has been encoded into the URI of a `GET` request and a `POST` request should be used instead."
    end

    entry do
      name '415 Unsupported media type'
      notes "The client provided data with a media type that the server does not support."
    end

    end

    entry do
      name '428 Precondition required'
      notes "The origin server requires the request to be conditional.

Intended to be used when resource access is denied for legal reasons, e.g. censorship or government-mandated blocked access. A reference to the 1953 dystopian novel Fahrenheit 451, where books are outlawed."
    end

    entry do

      notes "A generic status for an error in the server itself."
    end

    entry do
      name '501 Not implemented'
